# Echo
## A Social Media Platform 

[Visit the live site here!(https://echo.kormir.dev/)

Created as my week 9 project for Tech Educators Full Stack Software Development Bootcamp, Echo is a slight tongue in cheeck play on the term 'echo chamber'. This platform enables people to create an account and profile, log in and post sentiments for others to see. 

Users can create their own sentiments, add thoughts (comments) to other sentiments, and like sentiments. Users can also visit the profiles of other users (including their own) to see their basic information and post history. 

## Tecnologies Used

- Next.js
- JavaScript
- CSS

I would like to add the functionality to 'echo' (report) other sentiments in the future.
